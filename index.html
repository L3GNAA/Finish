<h4>Hybrid Approach</h4>
<p>I'll be going with a Hybrid - Iterative approach. It lets me stay on track and prioritize deliverables, as well as adapting flexibly while moving toward a fulfilling promised vision statement.</p>

<h4>Microsoft Planner</h4>
<p>I went with Microsoft Planner. Visually the tool has a great aesthetic, with a user-friendly interface to boot. I particularly enjoy the automated variety of view-boards, my favorite being the charts tabs. There is an option given to attach URL links for assignments which isn't ideal, but seeing as I'll be using GitHub as a repository convenience won't be an issue.</p>
