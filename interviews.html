        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Okay. So, my name is Angel Contreras. I'm a graduating student at California State University, Los Angeles. I am currently taking a project management course and seeking insights from professionals. I've reached out to Karine Citadel for a brief interview about their project management experience. Welcome. Thank you for making time for me today. I sent you a few links; the important one being my web portfolio, the other being the Google form for today's feedback.</p>
        <p>Essentially, my project is creating a roadmap, fulfilling certain key deliverables such as creating the web portfolio, polishing up my LinkedIn and resume, and attempting to appeal to the right business ventures. However, I do plan to accomplish official employment within one or multiple of these companies. I've had to adjust accordingly to the demands of this market by incorporating AI into a portion of my work. The most important aspect I've learned from this journey is not whether AI will be the replacement, but rather someone using AI.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this is my first time making a personal website that hasn't been entirely dependent on a grade. I've placed personal finances into this project, demonstrating value, and I'm sure others will see that value as well.</p>
        <p>So, Miss Citadel, I have some questions for you. I'm going to start off with the first one right here. Just pull it up. Let's see. So, Samuel. Okay. So, the first question I want to ask you is: How do you use project management in your life or job?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>Well, project management is the backbone of nearly everything I do, professionally and personally. In my work, I use it to structure projects from start to finish: defining objectives, planning timelines, allocating resources, and coordinating with different stakeholders. It keeps me organized and sane; I think that's the most important part. It really keeps me sane, and it ensures that nothing falls through the cracks, and I like that. I like to have the precision and the organization, or really plan ahead so I can perform better.</p>
        <p>In my personal life, project management shows up in the way I plan major transitions, manage finances, organize travel, and even set long-term goals. Breaking big objectives into smaller tasks is also something that it helps me with as well, along with setting deadlines and monitoring progress. All of that really gives me the clarity and the control over whatever it is that I'm doing. Overall, I would say that project management helps me make better decisions, anticipate problems, and stay accountable to my commitments.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>What advice do you have for me and my classmates who are learning about project management?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>I would say to start by mastering the basics: scope, time, resources, and risks. Know that these fundamentals never change. No matter how complex a project becomes, you are always going to have those fundamentals, and I think it's important for you to master them.</p>
        <p>I would also say don't fall into the trap of thinking that project management is just a tool. As I explained before, you can use it in your everyday life; you can use it for everything, really. It's really about people, communication, clarity, and expectation setting, and I think those are just more important than software, I would say.</p>
        <p>What else can I tell you? It will teach you how to learn to think ahead of any type of commitment. You are going to have to be proactive in everything that you do, and it's going to become a habit. So much so that you won't even have to think about the fundamentals anymore as far as specific steps; it will just be implemented into your actions.</p>
        <p>Strong project managers are always scanning for risks and preparing solutions before a problem actually arises. I think this is something that you build over time because you always want to be ahead of everything. By thinking about all the scenarios that can present themselves, you can actually anticipate what is going to come towards you, and you will be better at it. You will have a better reputation by just being that person that people go to when it comes to planning, because you already know what can possibly happen and how to take care of that possible issue that can arise.</p>
        <p>Finally, I would say stay curious because every project will teach you something different, something new about leadership, teamwork, and human behavior. That is an important one. The more adaptable and open you are, the stronger you will be in this field.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Okay. [Note: The screen accidentally clicked off.] Okay. What qualities do you look for in people you hire or work with?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>I look for people who are reliable, communicative, and proactive. Basically, just like me. Those three components that I just mentioned, to me, provide insight into that person and how that person is going to work with you. If you are reliable, if you can communicate, if you can anticipate, those are skills for me that you should have.</p>
        <p>Reliability matters more than talent, according to me. If someone constantly follows through, the entire team becomes stronger, and that's important to note. Communication is essential. I want people who are clear, honest, and able to convey information without drama or confusion. I think that's very important too.</p>
        <p>I value individuals who take initiative instead of waiting to be told what to do, just basically like me, you know. [I look for] problem solvers who stay calm under pressure and look for solutions rather than excuses. It is very easy to actually hide behind excuses, where in reality you have to be able to always try to anticipate what the issue is going to be and what the solution already is before it arises.</p>
        <p>I also look for emotional intelligence: people who manage themselves well, collaborate respectfully, and elevate the team rather than drain it, and I think that's important too. Ultimately, the best people to work with are those who are accountable, curious, and committed to doing their best.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>All right, Miss Citadel, those were all my interview questions for you. Thank you again so much for your time.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>Of course, my pleasure.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Re-watching our recorded time. So, yeah, it's going to be fun re-watching this [and] seeing how I performed. I definitely want to see the feedback on—</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>Well, good luck. Good luck. I'm very happy that you're doing that, and good luck with everything that you're going to start. Wishing you the best.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>All right. All right, Miss Citadel, thank you so much for your time. Have an amazing rest of your day.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>You're welcome.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>It was nice to meet you. Take care. Bye-bye.</p>

      <h4>Interview #3 — Daniel Thatch, IT Support Professional</h4>
      <p>Summary: Daniel shared how he applies project management differently in personal and professional contexts. Key insights include using project management for personal goals like diet planning, creating SOPs for business continuity, leveraging AI tools for efficiency rather than replacement, prioritizing self-sufficiency and workflow control, and valuing responsiveness and commitment when working with others.</p>

      <div id="transcript3" class="transcript">
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Let's start. Okay. Hi, my name is Angel Contreras. I'm a graduating student at California State University, Los Angeles. Currently taking a project management course and seeking insights from professionals. I've reached out to Daniel Thatch for a brief interview about their project management experience. Welcome. Thank you for making time for me today. I sent you a few links, the important one being my web portfolio, the other being a Google form for today's feedback.</p>
        <p>So essentially my project is creating a roadmap fulfilling certain key deliverables such as creating a web portfolio, polishing up my LinkedIn and resume, attempting to appeal to the right business ventures. I've successfully been able to connect with a few employers by networking, but it's still too soon for any celebrations. However, I do plan to accomplish official employment with one or multiple of these companies. I've had to adjust accordingly to the demands of this current job market by incorporating AI into a portion of my work. The most important aspect I've learned on this journey is not whether AI will be the replacement, but rather someone using AI.</p>
        <p>Upon reflection of this project, I wish I could have reached out to my guests a little bit sooner with the holidays and all, but here we are. In conclusion, this is my first time making a personal website that wasn't entirely dependent on a grade. I've placed personal finances into this project, demonstrating value, and I'm sure others will see value in that as well.</p>
        <p>Daniel Thatch, how do you use project management in your life or job?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Daniel Thatch:</p>
        <p>Well, okay. So, we actually split those two categories, life and job. They are two different objectives for me. In my personal life, I try to set a goal for myself and that is already like the basis of a top-down project management, right? You define your goals and then you break that down from there how you execute it.</p>
        <p>For example, in my personal life, I try to attempt a version of keto diet which means that I had to eat less carbohydrates, but I started to regulate myself and you have to break it down to the smaller details like okay so how do you control how much macros you take in, how do you still budget out friendly with my current income, and those are like some of the things that I do. And in life you can always make a project out of anything so long as the goal suffices and you know your scope and your execution, and that's like a good way to practice.</p>
        <p>And in my professional life, I currently work in the tech industry at Gigabyte at their USA branch as the internal IT support. And my current project—this is something I can disclose—I currently work as IT support where I am defining all the SOPs which are standard operating procedures in the event that the IT department does go down; people are still able to operate the business in procedural manners.</p>
        <p>And so what I do is I create handouts so that I can also implement them, and project management helps me in a way where I had to define the goals and how I had to do it, which is create SOPs, but also how I actually had to execute it because I could write as many documents as I want, but if I don't actually find a way to make people read them then it's the same thing as me just going on YouTube and watching videos all day and still getting paid the same, right?</p>
        <p>So project management is not just about the execution; it's about the implementation and the humane aspects, the logical aspects, and also the personal aspects. How do you want to improve it, how can you make it efficient? You don't want to waste people's time, but you don't actually want to waste your own time as well. So, it's a little bit balancing of both. And that's how I would use it normally in life and in jobs.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Okay. What advice do you have for me and my classmates who are learning about project management?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Daniel Thatch:</p>
        <p>Okay. So, my personal advice is that unlike in the academic setting where there's always policies as if you're a student, in the real world, you have to use every tool at your disposal, right? So in my job, I found that not using AI is horribly inefficient. It doesn't mean that you should use AI to replace your cognitive functions, but you should use it to assist you in making you more efficient.</p>
        <p>And I personally use that in terms of actually formatting, improving my documents because instead of actually going back and editing, I would just vomit out words and tell the AI, hey, how can you improve this? And then they would give me suggestions and I would just keep doing it.</p>
        <p>It also applies to other stuff outside of project management. When you're actually trying to—if you're a CIS student and you're trying to actually break into the IT world, the reality is that you're going to need to actually spend a lot of your time researching, R&D. And whether you have questions, AI is the most efficient way to fetch answers, especially something that needs to be broken down to cater to your cognitive needs, whatever you need to understand, and that's my advice.</p>
        <p>Use every tool at your disposal. Best way is to actually create projects where you can utilize new tools and get familiar with them. Don't just do certifications. Don't just do readings and fake lab work. Implement them in some way.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Okay. Use your tools efficiently. Are there any qualities you look for in people you hire or work with?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Daniel Thatch:</p>
        <p>Okay. I can answer on behalf of someone else in a secondhand quote, right? My boss, when he hires someone, he tells me personally that what he looks for in quality is that you're self-sufficient. When you are hired, you are able to get yourself to be busy for x amount of hours, whether you're a part-time or you're full-time where you're eight hours, you're able to actually do something efficiently.</p>
        <p>Of course, he's not going to expect you to work all the time. But the qualities of a person are: Are they able to control their workflow? Like let's say I give you a deadline, it doesn't matter really how you actually finish it. It's more important that you do do the work in the end, the due diligence. That's why you are technically hired and that's what they look for and probably what I personally would look for if I ever get myself into a role.</p>
        <p>I want someone to be self-sufficient, but I also want someone who is also able to ask questions when they can't find an answer or find a starting point to look for the answers. So, someone's asking me, hey, how do I set up a voice over IP with a telecom network on a service like 3CX, which is a voice over IP service for calling in internal networks? Then it's obvious you can't just look that up on Google out of nowhere. You have to ask someone. So, I look for someone that would personally be able to do that.</p>
        <p>And if I'm looking for some qualities for someone who I want to work with, I would want someone that is responsive. So, I don't mind if someone's late or someone's unable to do certain tasks due to personal reasons. That's something that life has to take over and life happens. What I do look for is that when they speak, when they say something, they commit, make a commitment and they speak it out. It's kind of like a contract. Like I'm going to do this, then as a boss or as a coworker I expect you to actually do that. I'm going to rely on you on that task and I don't want to be your babysitter. I want you to be self-sufficient on your own and that's the same thing I try to look for in a coworker who I work with basically.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>All superb answers, Daniel Thatch. Thank you so much for your time. And yeah, I'm going to use this information to push forward into my future as well as other business practices. Thank you for your time and happy Thanksgiving.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Daniel Thatch:</p>
        <p>Happy Thanksgiving to you.</p>
