        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Okay. So, my name is Angel Contreras. I'm a graduating student at California State University, Los Angeles. I am currently taking a project management course and seeking insights from professionals. I've reached out to Karine Citadel for a brief interview about their project management experience. Welcome. Thank you for making time for me today. I sent you a few links; the important one being my web portfolio, the other being the Google form for today's feedback.</p>
        <p>Essentially, my project is creating a roadmap, fulfilling certain key deliverables such as creating the web portfolio, polishing up my LinkedIn and resume, and attempting to appeal to the right business ventures. However, I do plan to accomplish official employment within one or multiple of these companies. I've had to adjust accordingly to the demands of this market by incorporating AI into a portion of my work. The most important aspect I've learned from this journey is not whether AI will be the replacement, but rather someone using AI.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this is my first time making a personal website that hasn't been entirely dependent on a grade. I've placed personal finances into this project, demonstrating value, and I'm sure others will see that value as well.</p>
        <p>So, Miss Citadel, I have some questions for you. I'm going to start off with the first one right here. Just pull it up. Let's see. So, Samuel. Okay. So, the first question I want to ask you is: How do you use project management in your life or job?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>Well, project management is the backbone of nearly everything I do, professionally and personally. In my work, I use it to structure projects from start to finish: defining objectives, planning timelines, allocating resources, and coordinating with different stakeholders. It keeps me organized and sane; I think that's the most important part. It really keeps me sane, and it ensures that nothing falls through the cracks, and I like that. I like to have the precision and the organization, or really plan ahead so I can perform better.</p>
        <p>In my personal life, project management shows up in the way I plan major transitions, manage finances, organize travel, and even set long-term goals. Breaking big objectives into smaller tasks is also something that it helps me with as well, along with setting deadlines and monitoring progress. All of that really gives me the clarity and the control over whatever it is that I'm doing. Overall, I would say that project management helps me make better decisions, anticipate problems, and stay accountable to my commitments.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>What advice do you have for me and my classmates who are learning about project management?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>I would say to start by mastering the basics: scope, time, resources, and risks. Know that these fundamentals never change. No matter how complex a project becomes, you are always going to have those fundamentals, and I think it's important for you to master them.</p>
        <p>I would also say don't fall into the trap of thinking that project management is just a tool. As I explained before, you can use it in your everyday life; you can use it for everything, really. It's really about people, communication, clarity, and expectation setting, and I think those are just more important than software, I would say.</p>
        <p>What else can I tell you? It will teach you how to learn to think ahead of any type of commitment. You are going to have to be proactive in everything that you do, and it's going to become a habit. So much so that you won't even have to think about the fundamentals anymore as far as specific steps; it will just be implemented into your actions.</p>
        <p>Strong project managers are always scanning for risks and preparing solutions before a problem actually arises. I think this is something that you build over time because you always want to be ahead of everything. By thinking about all the scenarios that can present themselves, you can actually anticipate what is going to come towards you, and you will be better at it. You will have a better reputation by just being that person that people go to when it comes to planning, because you already know what can possibly happen and how to take care of that possible issue that can arise.</p>
        <p>Finally, I would say stay curious because every project will teach you something different, something new about leadership, teamwork, and human behavior. That is an important one. The more adaptable and open you are, the stronger you will be in this field.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Okay. [Note: The screen accidentally clicked off.] Okay. What qualities do you look for in people you hire or work with?</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>I look for people who are reliable, communicative, and proactive. Basically, just like me. Those three components that I just mentioned, to me, provide insight into that person and how that person is going to work with you. If you are reliable, if you can communicate, if you can anticipate, those are skills for me that you should have.</p>
        <p>Reliability matters more than talent, according to me. If someone constantly follows through, the entire team becomes stronger, and that's important to note. Communication is essential. I want people who are clear, honest, and able to convey information without drama or confusion. I think that's very important too.</p>
        <p>I value individuals who take initiative instead of waiting to be told what to do, just basically like me, you know. [I look for] problem solvers who stay calm under pressure and look for solutions rather than excuses. It is very easy to actually hide behind excuses, where in reality you have to be able to always try to anticipate what the issue is going to be and what the solution already is before it arises.</p>
        <p>I also look for emotional intelligence: people who manage themselves well, collaborate respectfully, and elevate the team rather than drain it, and I think that's important too. Ultimately, the best people to work with are those who are accountable, curious, and committed to doing their best.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>All right, Miss Citadel, those were all my interview questions for you. Thank you again so much for your time.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>Of course, my pleasure.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>Re-watching our recorded time. So, yeah, it's going to be fun re-watching this [and] seeing how I performed. I definitely want to see the feedback on—</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>Well, good luck. Good luck. I'm very happy that you're doing that, and good luck with everything that you're going to start. Wishing you the best.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Angel Contreras:</p>
        <p>All right. All right, Miss Citadel, thank you so much for your time. Have an amazing rest of your day.</p>
        
        <p class="speaker">Karine Citadel:</p>
        <p>You're welcome.</p>
